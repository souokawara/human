We are human, after all
Much in common, after all

 “Fatal Error: Your Story Doesn’t Make Sense”, the compiler was tough, the-Simpsons-like-nietzschean-cartoon, he’d called so, failed. He needed a language that concealed the queer in the legitimate, like a mirage the image of pop faded away, as he became serious about grabbing it. But he’d already known, it’s nothing but serious: somewhere between nothing and serious. All he could do was wait, for the next. The cheaper the shrine was, the better to make it. Neil Sedaka had sung calendar girls, righteously, he’d been a pop nerd. Like Neil, he wanted to compile his desires.

 He called himself “R”, to make him a deracine, from the cult-society. He felt he’s on a window-less train, on the honeymoon with his mechanical bride. “Living is easy with eyes closed”, the favorite phrase, a refrain of his life was the macro motif of the world. He didn’t want to make a compilation of newspapers, anymore. He loved his life, as a monk, as a receiver of cosmic jive, for him. Pulling was his new attitude, not to be pushed around. Tezuka, his doctor, had known something about this postmodern phenomenon.

 R was tackling a magnificent system, new to the world, and turning on its mechanism, which rendered a story in space. It gave proteins for memes, people could touch. A bunch of stories had been got their bodies. "Pinocchio", "Frankenstein", "Micky Mouse", etc, etc. They're strolling in the town. They had been perfections incarnate, in a way they'd been pictured, animated. They could be downloaded on any device. R couldn't make it still, for it required a certain fineness, in its formative design. Somebody made it in one's first attempt, another couldn't pass forever.
